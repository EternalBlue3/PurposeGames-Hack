# PurposeGames-Hack

Javascript folder explanation:

The two programs located in the "JavaScript" folder are identical, except one is formatted as a bookmarklet. The program sends a post request containing false score data to trick the server into allowing you to have any score you desire. You can paste the "RequestBypass.js" program into the console or use the "Bookmarklet.js" program as a bookmarklet.

You can utilize these programs on https://www.purposegames.com.
